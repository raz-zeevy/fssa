## Introduction

Welcome to the `fssa` application! This desktop application provides a robust and user-friendly framework for statistical data analysis and visualization, with a focus on Faceted Smallest Space Analysis (FSSA). Our goal is to make complex data analysis more accessible and efficient for researchers, data scientists, and statisticians.

## About the Project

The `fssa` project, inspired by the original Faceted SSA for Windows (FSSAWIN), is designed to streamline the process of statistical data analysis. It includes a variety of tools and functionalities, such as data parsing, statistical modeling, and graphical representation of data, with a focus on ease of use without compromising the depth of analysis.

### Faceted Smallest Space Analysis (FSSA)

Faceted Smallest Space Analysis (FSSA) is a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) procedure that optionally allows for the incorporation of content classifications (=facets) of the mapped objects into the analysis and testing their validity. FSSA maps objects (typically variables) in a space of prespecified dimensionality to represent pairwise similarity or dissimilarity observed between them. The (dis)similarity measures are either precomputed or computed by the program from data files.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### Understanding Your Data

Before starting with FSSA, it's crucial to understand the data you are working with:

#### CASE I: Matrix Material

- Ensure the (dis)similarity matrix is accessible on your computer.
- Know the matrix file's name and full path (e.g., `\mydir\simil.mat`).
- Understand the matrix format in the file, including the number of fields per row, columns per field, and decimal places used.
- Determine if coefficients represent similarity (e.g., correlations) or dissimilarity (e.g., distance).
- Identify any missing values in the matrix.

#### CASE II: Data

- Verify the data set is in an ASCII file of fixed format and recoded appropriately.
- Know the data file's name and full path (e.g., `A:\mydir\recod.dat`).
- Understand the structure of the data file, including records per case and the location of each variable.
- Identify valid and missing values for each variable.

#### Facet Option

- You may choose to run a simple SSA without facets or use the facet option for more complex analysis.
- For the facet option, have a substantive criterion for classifying the variables.

### Results and Output

- By default, FSSA results are saved in `FSSA.RES`.
- You can change the file names, save to different directories, or direct output to a printer.

### Inspecting and Printing Diagrams

- The program produces screen diagrams of the solution and facet diagrams.
- After completion, these diagrams can be re-displayed for inspection.
- To print the diagrams, use the view menu and follow the instructions for your specific printer.
