To run Faceted SSA, press: FSSACMD.BAT . the content of FSSACMD.BAT is:
FASSA.BAT MONO MONOINP.DRV C:\DJPKM2~1\GRANDF~1.PRN NUL MONOASC.MAT FSSAINP.DRV MONOASC.MAT C:\DJPKM2~1\djpkm14v.FSS
FASSA.BAT is a Fortran batch file that controls the running of the program (see separate file).
FASSA.BAT requires 8 parameters:
MONO  Tells Fortran to run monotonicity coefficients on the data. Replace by PEARSON if you want SSA to use Pearson correlation coefficients instead.
MONOINP.DRV   A file in a specific format (see monoinp.drv instructions file) that tells the program how to read data file for computing the monotonicity coefficients. Replace by PEARINP.DRV if you want SSA to use Pearson correlation coefficients.
C:\DJPKM2~1\GRANDF~1.PRN  an example of Path and filename of the input data file in ASCII (simple txt file). You can change it to fit with your own directory, and you can simplify filename. For example, c:\tstfssa\tstdata.dat
NUL Indicates that you donâ€™t want the program to produce a file with a simplified version of the coefficient matrix. IF you do want such a file replace NUL by a filename of your choice.
MONOASC.MAT is the name of the coefficient-matrix-file produce by the program
FSSAINP.DRV A file in a specific format (see fssainp.drv instructions file) that tells the program how to read data file and what you want done.
MONOASC.MAT is the name of the coefficient-matrix-file produced by the program to be used by FSSA. It must be re-written here; I don't know why.
C:\DJPKM2~1\djpkm14v.FSS  Path and filename of the output data file. You can change it to your own directory, and simplify filename. For example  c:\tstfssa\tstdata.fss
